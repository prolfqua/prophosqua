Description: Implements a workflow for TMT-labeled samples where phospho-enriched
    and total proteome datasets are acquired and searched separately (e.g., with
    FragPipe/MSFragger). Both datasets are statistically evaluated individually:
    total proteome data is rolled up to protein level while phospho-enriched data
    is kept phospho-site centric. Differential expression analysis uses the
    prolfqua R package for normalization, transformation, aggregation, and linear
    modeling with contrasts. By joining both datasets, the package enables
    Differential PTM Abundance (DPA) and Differential PTM Usage (DPU) analysis,
    distinguishing true phosphorylation changes from protein expression effects.
