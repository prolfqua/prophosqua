\title{Plot Sequence Logos with Difference Column}
\usage{
plot_seqlogo_with_diff(sig_sites)
}
\arguments{
\item{sig_sites}{A data frame containing significant phosphorylation sites
with required columns: \code{contrast}, \code{regulation}, and
\code{SequenceWindow}.}
}
\value{
A patchwork object combining sequence logos with 3 columns per
  contrast row: upregulated, downregulated, and difference logos.
  Returns \code{NULL} if no contrasts have both upregulated and
  downregulated sequences.
}
\description{
Creates a 3-column sequence logo plot showing upregulated sites,
downregulated sites, and their difference (Up - Down) for each contrast.
The difference column uses an independent y-axis scale appropriate for
showing positive and negative frequency differences.
}
\details{
For each contrast, three sequence logos are displayed:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Upregulated}: Amino acid frequencies at sites with increased
    phosphorylation (y-axis: 0-1)
  \item \strong{Downregulated}: Amino acid frequencies at sites with decreased
    phosphorylation (y-axis: 0-1)
  \item \strong{Difference}: The difference in frequencies (Up - Down), where
    positive values indicate enrichment in upregulated sites (y-axis: symmetric
    around 0)
}
}
