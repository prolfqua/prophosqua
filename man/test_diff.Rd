\arguments{
\item{phos_res}{Data frame with phospho site-level results}

\item{tot_res}{Data frame with protein-level results}

\item{join_column}{Character vector of columns to join by}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Joins site-level and protein-level results, computes difference-of-differences,
and performs t-tests for differential PTM usage.
