prophosqua — Integration of phosphoproteome and total proteome data for comprehensive PTM analysis.

Implements three complementary statistical approaches:
- DPA (Differential PTM Abundance): tests for changes in PTM-site intensity between conditions.
- DPU (Differential PTM Usage): tests whether the ratio of PTM-site to total protein intensity changes, identifying regulation independent of protein abundance.
- CorrectFirst: applies protein-level correction before testing PTM sites.

Additional features: N-to-C plots, sequence logo analysis, PTM-SEA, kinase activity inference (Kinase Library), and motif enrichment analysis (MEA).

Built on prolfqua (https://github.com/prolfqua/prolfqua) and prolfquapp (https://github.com/prolfqua/prolfquapp).
