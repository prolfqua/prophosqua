# Springer Protocols Manuscript Instructions

## LENGTH

**For editors:** The ideal length of your manuscript is specified in your contract. This page count includes references, tables and figure legends.

**For authors:** Please consult with your editor for the appropriate length of your chapter, and number of figures. Chapters tend to average between 15-20 typed pages (not including images, tables, and references), but there is no limit on length of chapter or number of figures to be included. Please submit your chapter to the volume editor and not directly to Springer.

## ILLUSTRATIONS

**For authors and editors:**

Please submit your illustrations in an electronic form, please submit the original graphic files. Do not insert figures into your Word document. Springer prefers that files be submitted in TIFF or EPS format, with at least 300 dpi resolution (600 is preferred). PDF, JPG, Excel, and PowerPoint files may also be acceptable. Please check with your editor if you have questions regarding specific figures.

Remember when considering figures that they will probably be reduced to fit onto a book page, so pay particular attention to making labels highly legible and not too small. You may want to photocopy your figures to the expected final size as a test to determine legibility. The usable page size of the book will usually be about 4.5 x 7.5 inches. Most figures (including their caption) will occupy half a page. Labels should be in a sans-serif font, preferably Helvetica. When at final reduction the size should be no smaller than 8 point.

Please ensure that your figures are clearly labeled. Number tables separately. Please submit your images to Springer in full color when possible. All electronic versions of the book will publish in full color, including the e-book versions and the chapters available on our online book database, Springer Link (Springerlink.com).

## BOOK COVER

If there is an image appearing in the book that you would like to use for the cover, please note this when submitting the manuscript. While all of our book covers are designed by our Art Department, we like to use an image appearing in the book. Please make sure that the image selected does not require permissions and is acceptable to the chapter author who submitted the figure. While we try to ensure the image you select is used, we cannot guarantee that your image will be used for the cover.

## FORMATTING

**For authors and editors:**

While we find it the most productive for authors to work with software tools with which they are most comfortable, we prefer that manuscripts are submitted in Microsoft Word. This makes the review and production of the book move much quicker. If you need to work in a program that is not Microsoft Word, please contact us so we can ensure we have the program on hand during submission.

If you need to submit your manuscript using LaTeX, please include a PDF of your chapter as well. This pdf will ensure that all formatting remains intact during the copyediting and typesetting process.

Please ensure that all material, including figure and table captions, is double-spaced throughout. There should be a left and right hand margin of at least one inch on all pages.

### Chapter Guidelines

The purpose of this series is to provide individual volumes that describe detailed practical procedures for a particular subject area. Although the research literature contains descriptions of practical procedures, extensive practical detail is not always presented, and, more particularly, an idea of the problems that can be encountered and how they are identified and overcome is rarely included. This series aims to address these deficiencies. Each chapter in a volume of this series should therefore be one specific method, written such that a competent scientist who is unfamiliar with the method can carry out the technique successfully at the first attempt by simply following the detailed practical procedures that you have described. The success of the series is, in large part, due to the usefulness of the "Notes" section. Chapters tend to average 15-20 double-spaced typed pages, but can be longer or shorter as necessary. Wet-lab protocols must be written in the format described below (A Sample Chapter is included as a reference). Non wet-lab chapters such as reviews, bioinformatics chapters, and methods that don't can't follow the formalized style below can be submitted in whatever format the author wishes.

### Chapter Structure

Please arrange your chapter text file in the following order:

**i. Chapter Title**

**ii. Summary/Abstract**  
In one or two paragraphs, please write a brief overview of the method described (this is the abstract that appears on sites such as PubMed).

**iii. Key Words**  
Please include 5-10 key words for referencing by electronic databases and search engines.

1. **Introduction**  
   This section should contain a summary of, and the outline of any theory to, the method that you're are describing. It should also outline the major procedures involved in the protocol.

2. **Materials**  
   This section should list the composition of all buffers, media, solutions, and specialist equipment etc., that are necessary for carrying out the method described in section 3. Suppliers aren't needed for routine reagents (the reader will use his/her own local supplier) and catalogue numbers aren't required at all for reagents. All buffers, solutions and media should be presented in the same format i.e. name, colon then composition on one continuous line, with components separated by commas not semi-colons. Do not list individual reagents, but do describe the composition of the solutions, etc they are used in.

3. **Methods**  
   This is the main section and should explain in detail the individual steps necessary to carry out the technique. Where possible, please simply list the steps in numerical order. For techniques that comprise a number of separate major procedures, please indicate these separate procedures in the introduction, and then subdivide section 3 into subheadings to cover each procedure (3.1, 3.2 etc). The steps in each subsection should then be numbered individually, renumbering from number one. Do take great care to try to indicate any little "tricks" or nuances that help improve your method by referring to relevant "notes" in section 4 (see below). This sort of information rarely gets into the scientific literature. You may also find it useful to relate to some aspects of the theory in this section indicating the purpose of some of the major steps by cross-referencing to an appropriate "note". Do not be tempted to get involved in the description of variations/alternatives to your technique in this section: this can be done in the "Notes" section. Stick to the basic procedure detailed in this section. This section must be comprehensive. Do not send the reader away to find information for a particular step in another reference. All relevant practical detail must be given in this section.

4. **Notes**  
   As we all know, even the simplest techniques go wrong from time to time. Would you therefore indicate any major problems or faults that can occur with your technique? Try to indicate the major sources of problems and how they can be identified and overcome. With reference to related techniques, any variations of the technique that you have described should also be made in this section, as well as--where relevant--an indication of the sensitivity of the method, timescale for the singled technique, etc. This "Notes" section is a hallmark of this series and has been singled out for praise by a number of reviewers. Please try and make this section as extensive as possible by putting on paper all of your various experiences with the technique. Each 'Note' should be cross-referenced with the 'Materials' and 'Methods' sections, e.g. (see Note 1).

5. **References**  
   Arabic numbers should be used for text citations (set within parentheses at point of citation), and they should be listed in numerical order in text, as well as in the reference section. Please be as comprehensive as possible with the references.

### Additional Components

- **Figure Captions**
- **Table Captions**  
- **Tables** -- Always to be included at the end of the document.
- **Figures** should be submitted as separate files. Please do not include them in the Manuscript. Please include them as separate files clearly labeled (Fig 1, Fig 1A. Fig 2, etc).

### Important Requirements

- Please include a cover page that includes the names, affiliations, and e-mail address of the corresponding author on the first page of your chapter.

- Please include ALL AUTHORS on your manuscript at the time of submission. Once a book enters production, AUTHORS CANNOT BE ADDED TO THE CHAPTER.

- In addition, please provide us with a "Running Head" (a "Running Head" is an amended/shortened version of your chapter title that appears at the top of each page in the final version of the book). This should be no more than 60 characters (including spaces).

- Please make sure all figures are referenced in the text. If you would like a figure to appear at a particular point in the book, write "[Fig X near here]" in the body of the text. Otherwise, all figures will be placed on the page on which they are referenced.

- Please do not use fancy formatting in the manuscript unless for a good reason. Use one font type only (preferably Times New Roman, or Palatino) bold, roman and italic only. Complex formatting can confuse electronic typesetting processes, and we will be producing the book to our own book designs.

- Please ensure all mathematical variables are in italics.

For details of nomenclature and details of chemical standards and so on please refer to a standard guide such as the Chicago Manual of Style (Chicago University Press), or Scientific Style and Format: The CBE Manual for authors, editors, and publishers (Cambridge University Press). The important thing is to be consistent.

Springer will copyedit and typeset your book simultaneously, and return the files to you for approval of changes, answering of queries, and making of any final revisions to the book. After checking the copyediting, you return changes to us. Springer will enter the changes onto the file.

## PERMISSIONS

**For authors and editors:** Please remember that if you intend to use any figure, table, or lengthy text passage which has been previously published, you will need to formally request permission to use the material from the original publisher. This also applies to material previously published by Humana Press and Springer, and previously published material that is your own work. Please keep in mind that it can sometimes take a while for requests to process, and you should start this process as soon as possible. Grant letters for any necessary permissions should be submitted to your book's editor with your final chapter manuscript. If the figures have been redrawn so as to be "significantly different" from the original, then no permission is needed.

All reproduced figures should be cited in the text by either using the wording supplied by the original publisher, or by using a standard format such as "Reproduced from [Name Year] with permission from [Publisher]." The full citation should be included in your References.

**Most Permissions can be obtained by going to the publisher's website and filling out an online form or by using [RightsLink](http://www.copyright.com/rightsholders/rightslink-permissions/). This is usually the easiest and quickest way to obtain permissions!**

Some publishers may ask for a fee (for example AAAS the publishers of Science always ask about $25). According to your contract you are responsible for all permissions fees. Springer cannot cover the cost of these permissions.

Please make sure that we know to which figure each permission letter refers, by writing the figure number on the letter, or by preparing a figure log such as:

| Figure No | Copyright holder | Copyright holder's required wording |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 5.1 | Oxford University Press, New York | reproduced by permission of Oxford University Press ©1988 etc. |

**For editors:** Please ensure that all permissions have been granted before submitting the finished manuscript to Springer. Springer cannot start the production process until all permissions have been granted.

## REFERENCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY

**Please note** – the copyeditors will standardize the references (placing punctuation where need be, adding italics, etc) so please use the below as a reference.

### In the text

Number all references in order of use throughout the chapter, and indicate the reference by placing the number of the reference in bold, italicized parenthesis, like this **(6)**. All references are to be indicated like that **(7)** and should appear in numerical order throughout the text **(8)**.

**ENDNOTES:** If using the citation program, Endnotes, please use the SpringerBasicNumber bibliography format. You can download updated Springer EndNote reference styles at:

[https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/manuscript-preparation/5636](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/manuscript-preparation/5636) under the heading "Reference Styles."

## DOS AND DON'TS

**For authors and editors:**

### Do:
- Be consistent with style.
- Place figure captions at the end of the file or in a separate file. Do not place figures or captions "in place" on the manuscript page. Do not leave space for the figure in your electronic manuscript.
- Double-space the manuscript using your word processor's line-spacing function. Do not use hard returns or enters to double-space.
- Use two hyphens for a dash, with no space before or after them.

### Don't:
- Don't try to make your document look like a typeset page.
- Don't type the letter "el" (l) when you mean the number "one" (1) or vice versa. Even if the number cannot be distinguished from the letter in your printout or on your screen, it will appear differently in typeset output.
- Don't interchange "zero" (0) and capital "oh" (O).
- Don't justify your text.
- Don't indent paragraphs.
- If your book contains a lot of math, please consult with your editor to discuss submitting author-formatted files.
- Don't number the Preface, which is a brief introduction to the book by the Editor(s), as a chapter. The Preface is a part of what is called "front matter," and it is not numbered in the Table of Contents.

## SUBMISSION

**For authors:**

All key chapter authors must sign a _Contributor's Agreement_ (provided by your volume editor). Please submit this signed form with your final manuscript to your volume editor.

**For editors:**

Please include a Table of Contents, a Preface, and/or Forward, as well as an alphabetical List of Contributors (complete with affiliations) and a corresponding author list organized by chapter (complete with addresses) for your book. Please also note if there is an image or figure in the text that you would like to use for the book's cover (all covers are designed by our Art Department. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** We cannot always use the submitted artwork for your cover. While we always try to use your suggestions, we reserve the final approval of the cover).

Please contact your Springer Editor for submission of your book. While we prefer using online file sharing sites such as DropBox, we can accept manuscripts via the mail on USB or other methods after discussion. A hard copy of the manuscript is no longer necessary.

## VIDEO PROTOCOLS AND SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS

Springer has the ability to include supplementary materials, such as videos, datasets, software, and other files on our website. If you are interested in including any extra materials with your published book, please have your volume editor contact their Springer Editor.

In general we can accept any type of file. But general guidelines for videos to make them easier to process in production are:

- **Video Format:** H.264 preferred. Theora, MP4, MPG, MOV also accepted.
- **Audio Format:** MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis preferred.
- **Aspect Ratio:** Native aspect ratio without letterboxing (examples: 4:3, 16:9).
- **Resolution:** 1280 x 720 (HDready, 720p) or – if no HD available -: 1024 x 576 (PAL 16:9) or 768 x 576 (PAL 4:3)
- **Frames per second:** 30 or 24 preferred.
- **Maximum length:** 10 minutes rough maximum. We recommend 2-3 minutes as a typical length.
- **Maximum file size:** 1GB
- Please note that most modern phones (iPhone and Android) and cameras create H.264 videos by default. Most common video editing programs (such as Apple's iMovie software) will produce standard H.264 format video as well.

## OPEN ACCESS

We are now able to publish book chapters Open Access! Open Access publishing requires chapter authors to sign a different corresponding author agreement and to assign a person responsible for invoicing purposes once the book goes into production. If you are interested in publishing your book chapter Open Access or are under Funder requirements to do so, please contact your Publishing Editor directly. Information about license types and fees can be found at:

[https://www.springer.com/gp/open-access/books/faqs](https://www.springer.com/gp/open-access/books/faqs)

## SELF-ARCHIVING AND PRE-PRINT POLICIES

Authors whose work is accepted for publication in a non-open access Springer book may deposit their author's accepted manuscript (AAM) in their institutional or funder repository, provided that the following conditions are observed.

The author's accepted manuscript is the version of the book manuscript accepted for publication after peer review, but prior to copyediting and typesetting. The self-archived AAM should not include any changes made after the point of editorial acceptance. Any necessary amendments or corrections to article content should be made to the version of record (VoR) on the publisher platform.

**The embargo period for chapters is ONE YEAR AFTER PUBLICATION.**

In addition to the above policy, which applies to the author's accepted manuscript (AAM), authors may deposit a portion of the pre-submission version of their manuscript (preprint) in a recognised preprint server such as arXiv, biorXiv, or RePEc. No re-use rights apply. This portion of the pre-submission manuscript (preprint) may be deposited and made publicly available at any point.

For more information, please see:
